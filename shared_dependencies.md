Shared Dependencies:

1. Class Names: `DesignGuidelines`, `Feedback`, `Integrations`, `Main`, `MobileSupport`, `Navigation`, `Search`, `TestingInterface`, `VisualCues`. These class names are shared across multiple files as they are the main classes to be implemented in each module.

2. Method Names: `providing_feedback`, `searching_feedback`, `running_tests`, `integrating_IDEs`, `managing_agents`, `monitoring_agent_activity`, `initializing_projects`, `reviewing_code`, `initiating_chat`, `visualizing_data`, `interacting_with_avatars`, `checking_responsiveness`, `easy_navigation`, `unified_interface`, `tagging_feedback`, `updating_integration_status`, `updating_test_outputs`, `retrieving_test_outputs`, `updating_agent_activity`, `project_status`, `code_output`. These method names are shared across multiple files as they represent the functionalities to be implemented in the classes.

3. Data Schemas: The data schemas for feedback, agent activity, project status, test outputs, and code output would be shared across multiple files as they are used in various methods.

4. Message Names: Messages related to feedback, agent activity, project status, test outputs, and code output would be shared across multiple files as they are used in various methods.

5. DOM Element IDs: If the project involves a web interface, the IDs of DOM elements related to feedback, agent activity, project status, test outputs, and code output would be shared across multiple files as they are used in various methods.

6. Exported Variables: Variables related to feedback, agent activity, project status, test outputs, and code output would be shared across multiple files as they are used in various methods.
